This project consists of multple small assignments implemented with react. They are located in the directory called src.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Run command "npm install" in root directory to install the node modules:

Choose the app to run by modifying the line located in index.js:
```
import App from './GraphFormer';
```

In the project directory (src), you can run "npm start" to run the app. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The assignments include my own code, so it isn't marked with comments separately.

- texts.json
- translations.json
- logo.svg

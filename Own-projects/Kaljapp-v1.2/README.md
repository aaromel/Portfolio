# Overview

This project is an web application called 'Kaljapp' developed collaboratively by my friend and me. 

The application is an hub of sorts for restaurants (bars and nightclubs mainly). As of now, the application can be used to browse the restaurants of selected cities of Finland, including the opening hours, features, price level and additional information regarding the restaurants. Future features to be implemented contain menu listings and calendar for events in the certain restaurant. Functionality to allow the restaurant owners and personnel to edit the page of the restaurant is being worked on.

Frontend has been implemented using Angular and backend with Django. The database is PSQL based.
